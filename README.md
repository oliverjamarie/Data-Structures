Included data structures are generic.  In C++ this is implemented through templates which is part of the precompilation process.  This is why their implementation is in their header files instead of cpp files.

See Main.cpp to see implementation examples.

Data structures currently implemented
- Single Linked List
- Binary Search Tree

The data structures rely on Compare.h to compare variables.  If the variable type isn't primitive, you will need to implement a comparator function.
